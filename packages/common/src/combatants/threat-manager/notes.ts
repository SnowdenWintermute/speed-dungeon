// Threat Principles
// - Actions generate Cumulative and Volatile Threat
// - Healing generates higher volatile threat modifier than damage
// - Damage is more frequent and probably higher value than healing typically
//   which is why damage can still generate a lot of threat
// - Volatile threat decays at a constant rate at the end of every combatant turn
// - CE decays upon taking damage or being enfeebled
