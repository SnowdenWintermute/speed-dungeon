Basic Concepts

- Action enmity has a decaying (Cumulative Enmity, hereafter 'CE') and
  non-decaying component (Volatile Enmity - 'VE')
- Enmity is capped at 10000 VE and 10000 CE
- The maximum enmity any player can reach is 20,000 Total Enmity 'TE' - 10,000 CE and 10,000 VE.

Gaining Enmity

- All actions generate at least 1 CE
- Provoke generates 1800 VE and 1 CE
- The enmity generated by cure is CE = CEModifier x HPCured where CE Modifier is
  based on the level of the target being cured, where lower level targets have a higher modifier.
  Ex. on a level 1 target the modifiers are: CE 3.636 VE: 21.82 and on a level 75 are CE: 0.727 VE: 4.36
  or seemingly the VE modifier is 6x the CE modifier
- The enmity generated by damage behaves similarly to that of cure, but the CE and VE modifiers are at
  about a 1:3 ratio CE:VE, rather than the 1:6 ratio of cures

Losing Enmity

- The Volatile Enmity Decay Rate is -60 VE per second for all actions
- Absorbing a hit with Utsusemi reduces enmity by 25
- Enmity lost from taking damage is CE only and follows the formula:
  CELoss = 1800 x DamageTaken / TargetMaxHP
- Getting hit with enfeebling magic lowers your CE by 80
- Your CE will reset if a mob tries to target you and finds you unavailable

Enmity Gear

- Enmity Gear grants a direct percentage modification on Cumulative Enmity of actions.
- Enmity Gear does not affect the VE Hate Decay Rate in any fashion.
- Enmity Gear increases the VE of an ability in the same fashion as it affects CE - direct % increase.

Other notes:

- The current HP % of the target of the cure does not affect the amount of CE gained.
- The maximum HP of the target of the cure does not affect the amount of CE gained.
- The rate of VE decay is not related to the current total VE of a player.
- It is possible to have the highest TE of any player, yet not be the mob's target.
- The "Hate List" is not simply a list of players and their TE - it is separate from the TE counter.
- A mob chooses targets based on who has the highest TE of the players on the hate list.
